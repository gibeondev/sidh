# UI STANDARDS Phase 1 - Rules

## Routing & layout
- Use Next.js App Router.
- Public pre-registration routes live under app/(public)/pre-register/step-N/page.tsx.
- Pages should be thin orchestrators (composition + state), no heavy UI markup duplication.

## Component ownership
- Shared pre-registration components live in components/pre-register/:
  - Header, Stepper, Banner, StepActions
- Step-specific form content lives in components/pre-register/StepX*.tsx and receives props.
- Do not create duplicate variants (e.g., PreRegisterHeader2, StepperV2). Reuse and extend the existing ones.

## Form architecture
- Page owns the single source of truth for form state:
  - form: PreRegisterRequest (or a dedicated UI type)
  - setForm / onChange callbacks passed down
- Step components must not fetch or own global state. They only render and call onChange.

## Layout fidelity
- All form rows MUST use FormRow (two-column grid):
  - left label column fixed width (e.g. 240px)
  - right field column flexible
- Do not stack labels above inputs unless explicitly required by design.
- Use grid/flex only; no absolute positioning for layout.

## shadcn + Tailwind
- Use shadcn/ui components from components/ui/*
- Tailwind for spacing and layout. No inline styles.
- If a new UI pattern is needed, build a wrapper component in components/form/* or components/pre-register/*.

## Validation & UX
- Use react-hook-form consistently for forms.
- Frontend validation is UX-only; backend is the source of truth.
- Show field-level errors and a top-level submit error area.

## Navigation between steps
- StepActions handles Back/Next behavior.
- Step pages must not hardcode navigation UI; they render StepActions and pass handlers.
- No premature integration with login; keep pre-register flow usable without auth.

## MCP usage
- Use MCP/Figma frames as reference for layout.
- Prioritize structural fidelity (grid, spacing, typographic hierarchy) over pixel-perfect replication.
- When MCP output conflicts with our established FormRow/Stepper patterns, keep our patterns.
