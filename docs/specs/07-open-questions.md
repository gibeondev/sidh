# 07 — Open Questions (Phase 1)

## 0) Purpose
This document tracks **unresolved questions and pending decisions** for Phase 1.

It exists to:
- Prevent ambiguity from leaking into implementation
- Avoid Cursor making implicit decisions
- Make open items explicit and reviewable

Only **genuinely undecided** items belong here.

---

## 1) Rules for Using This Document

- Add an item **only if a decision is not yet made**
- Each item must be:
  - Clearly stated
  - Actionable
  - Scoped to Phase 1
- Once a decision is made:
  - Update the relevant spec file
  - Remove the item from this document

This document must **not** contain:
- Already decided rules
- Implementation bugs
- Temporary notes
- Ideas for later phases (those belong in backlog, not specs)
